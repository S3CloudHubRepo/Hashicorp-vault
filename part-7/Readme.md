# HashiCorp Vault Policy Management Tutorial

This README provides a reference for the commands used in the tutorial on managing policies in HashiCorp Vault.

## Commands Used in the Tutorial

### Section 1: Listing Vault Policies
```
$ vault policy list
```

### Section 2: Writing Your Custom Policy
```
$ vault policy write my-policy -
```
Insert the following HCL definitions:
```hcl
EOF
Dev servers have version 2 of KV secrets engine mounted by default, so will
need these paths to grant permissions:
path "secret/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}

path "secret/data/foo" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```
End this input with `EOF`.
Then run 
```hcl
vault policy list
```
for checking our policy created or not

### Section 3: Reading Vault Policy Details
```
$ vault policy read my-policy
```

### Section 4: Deleting a Vault Policy
```
$ vault policy delete my-policy
```

### Section 5: Attaching a Token to a Policy
```
$ export VAULT_TOKEN="$(vault token create -field token -policy=my-policy)"
```

### Section 6: Storing Credentials Using Your Policy
```
$ vault kv put -mount=secret creds password="my-long-password"
```
Now let's enable the approle
```hcl
vault auth enable approle
```
And verify with 
```hcl
vault auth list
```

### Section 7: Associating Auth Method with Policy
```
$ vault write auth/approle/role/my-role \
    secret_id_ttl=10m \
    token_num_uses=10 \
    token_ttl=20m \
    token_max_ttl=30m \
    secret_id_num_uses=40 \
    token_policies=my-policy
```

### Section 8: Generating and Exporting Role ID and Secret ID
Generate Role ID:
```
export ROLE_ID="$(vault read -field=role_id auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id)"
```
Generate Secret ID:
```
export SECRET_ID="$(vault write -f -field=secret_id auth/approle/role/my-role/secret-id)"
```

although right so now we have generated the role ID and the secret ID the next thing which we are gonna do we are just gonna perform some or we are just going to write some configuration using those role ID and the secret ID so this is the command which we are going to run 
```
vault write auth/approle/login role_id="$ROLE_ID" secret_id="$SECRET_ID"
```

## Conclusion

Follow these commands to manage policies effectively in your HashiCorp Vault setup.
